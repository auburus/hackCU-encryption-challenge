Encryption Challenge
=========

You have the instructions and the input file, and you should discover what
the encrypted message is.

One of the best challenges inside the hackathon!

#### Clues
There were some clues during the hackathon... those are mostly useless, at least
the first 4. (If you know what the clues are, we figured out clue 3 before they
published that, and it's the only one "useful").

## Disclaimer
The solution doesn't do everything, but I'm tired and its pretty trivial to do the
last part, so it's left as an exercise for the reader.
